ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Brian Miami (@Bmiami988), a passionate and ambitious data science enthusiast on a mission to master the art and science of extracting actionable insights from complex data. My journey revolves around exploring machine learning, predictive modeling, and data-driven storytelling to solve real-world problems.

Iâ€™m actively developing expertise in Python-based ML tools and libraries such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pandas, and Prophet. From data cleaning and feature engineering to building robust models and deploying them in production pipelines, Iâ€™m dedicated to learning every step of the data science lifecycle.

I love working on projects involving text analytics, clustering, classification, and time series forecastingâ€”bringing data to life with visualizations and meaningful interpretations. My goal is to become a skilled practitioner who not only builds powerful models but also communicates insights effectively.

Iâ€™m excited to collaborate on data science and machine learning projects where I can both contribute and learn. I believe in continuous growth, experimentation, and building practical solutions that create value.
